# Workflow

- Create an issue
  - The issue should state your intent on what you are trying to add, or what you are modifying in the repo.
  - Assignees: whoever is relevant
  - Projects: "Board Tracking"
  - Milestone optional
- Create a new branch
  - Easiest way to do this is `git switch -c [branch name]`
- Edit issue
  - Development: Assign branch
